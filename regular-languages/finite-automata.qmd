# Finite Automata

Sometimes easier than figuring out how to decompose something into a sequence of smaller blocks, we might draw what is called a **finite state automaton** (FSA) instead. For instance, for the no $11$s language, we make states representing the last character seen as we move through the string and if the last character was a $1$ and we see a second $1$, we know the string should be thrown out.
