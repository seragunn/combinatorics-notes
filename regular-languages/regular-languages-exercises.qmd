# Exercises

1. Consider the language $L = 0^*(11)^*$.
    a) List all words in $L$ of length $\le 6$.
    b) Let $a_n$ be the number of words in $L$ of length $n$. Using part a, guess a formula for $a_n$ (which may depend on whether $n$ is even or odd).
    c) Can you prove your formula?

## Hint
In words: $L$ describes languages with some number of $0$s followed by an even number of $1$s. So for instance, if $n = 9$, the possible number of $1$s is $0, 2, 4, 6, 8$ and there would be $5$ possible strings. The formula should look something like $n/2$ or $(n + 1)/2$.

2. Consider a tiling problem where we tile a $2 \times n$ grid using horizontal or vertical dominos ($1 \times 2$ or $2 \times 1$) or a $2 \times 2$ square. Let $\Sigma = \{V, H, S\}$ where $V$ represents a vertical domino, $H$ represents a horizontal domino, and $S$ represents a square. A tiling can be described by the language $L = \Sigma^*$.
    a) Let $f$ be the weight function describing the width. So $f(V) = 1, f(H) = f(S) = 2$. What is the generating function for $\Sigma$?
    b) What is the generating function for $L = \Sigma^*$?
    c) Using SageMath's Taylor series method, compute the number of such tilings of a $2 \times 10$ grid. Note: you have to write `2*x` rather than `2x` in SageMath.
    d) Using our techniques from recursion, what is a recursive formula for the number of tilings $t_n$? Compare this to the denominator of your OGF like in @sec-OGF-to-recursive-formula.

<div class="sage">
<script type="text/x-sage">
%display latex
OGF = 1/(1 - 2*x) # Modify this as appropriate
OGF.taylor(x, 0, 10) # Taylor series in x, centered at x = 0, of order 10
</script>
</div>

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Hint
The generating function of $\Sigma$ is
$$
\Phi_\Sigma = \sum_{w \in \Sigma} x^{f(w)} = x^{f(V)} + x^{f(H)} + x^{f(S)}.
$$
For b. use @thm-ogf-kleene.

For d. use the fact that a tiling of length $n$ is either:
* a tiling of length $n - 1$ followed by a vertical domino,
* a tiling of length $n - 2$ followed by either a pair of horizontal dominoes or a square (so $2$ options).

3. Draw a finite automata for:
    a) the language $0^*(11)^*$
    b) the language $(0 + 11)^*$

The automata in these notes were drawn using the [Mermaid Javascript library](https://mermaid.js.org/). You may wish to copy the following code to [mermaid.live](https://mermaid.live/) and modify it to create the FSA you need.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    direction LR
    classDef accept stroke-width:5px
    [*] --> 0
    0 --> 0 : 0
    0 --> 1 : 1
    1 --> 11 : 1
    11 --> 11 : 1

    class 0, 11 accept
```

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Hint
The FSA for part a should require only slight modification of the sample Mermaid diagram. Likewise, part b should require only slight modification from part a.
:::

4. Take the FSA from the previous question and perform state elimination to check if you recover the regular expression you started with. Remember to add in a termination state before you start eliminating.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Hint
Use the $ab^*c$ formula described in @sec-one-in-one-out on each path $A \to S \to B$ to eliminate $S$.

5. In [Example 8.18](https://www.appliedcombinatorics.org/book/s_genfunction_exponential.html#example-60) of Keller and Trotter's book, they show using exponential generating functions that the number of ternary strings with an even number of $0$s is $(3^n + 1)/2$. In this exercise, we will get this answer using ordinary generating functions.
    a) Draw a FSA for this language (you can do it in two states, not including the start and end).
    b) Perform state elimination to obtain a regular expression.
    c) Convert that regular expression to an OGF.
    d) Using SageMath, find a partial fraction decomposition for the OGF.
    e) Verify that the Taylor series is $\sum \frac{3^n + 1}{2} x^n$.

<div class="sage">
<script type="text/x-sage">
%display latex
OGF = 1/(1 - 2*x - 3*x^2) # Modify this as appropriate
OGF.partial_fraction()
</script>
</div>

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Hint
a) The start state will represent an even number of $0$s seen so far and another state will represent an odd number.
b) Eliminate the odd state using the elimination rule: `in(loop)*out`.
c) Replace $0, 1, 2$ by $x^1$ since each of those characters has length $1$.
d) Don't forget to use `2*x` rather than `2x`.
e) Use the formula $\frac{a}{1 - r} = \sum ar^n$.
