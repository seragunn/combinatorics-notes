# Preface

These notes were developed to accompany MTH 337: Applied Combinatorics during the Spring semester of 2024.
They are meant to be used interspersed with the material from Keller and Trotter's book [Applied Combinatorics](https://www.appliedcombinatorics.org/appcomb/).
Both these notes and Keller and Trotter's book are intended to have a heavy algorithmic and applied focus.

A sample sylabus is (KT is Keller and Trotter's book)

1. KT-2: Strings, Sets, and Binomial Coefficients
2. KT-3: Induction
3. KT-4.1: Pidgeonhole
    * Can cover the rest of KT-4 if students haven't seen "big-O" in their other courses yet
4. KT-5: Graph Theory
5. KT-7 and Inclusion-Exclusion from these notes for supplementary proofs
6. Permutations from these notes
7. KT-12, 13, 14 on graph algorithms (Prim/Kruskal, Dijkstra, Ford-Fulkerson/Edmonds-Karp)
8. Generating Functions from these notes
9. Regular Languages from these notes
