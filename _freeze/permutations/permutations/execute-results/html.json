This is also called *the symmetric group*.\n\n## As a shuffle of the symbols\n\nE.g. $53214$ is a shuffle of $X = \\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$.\n\nThis gives us one way of counting the number of permutations. For the first position in the shuffle, we may write any of the $n$ numbers. For the second position, we have $n - 1$ numbers to choose from---we cannot repeat the first. Likewise the third has $n - 2$ to choose from, not repeating the first or second. In this way, the number of permutations is\n\n$$\nn \\cdot (n - 1) \\cdot (n - 2) \\cdots 2 \\cdot 1, \\text{ denoted } n!.\n$$\n\n## As a function from $X$ to itself {#sec-function}\n\nE.g. The shuffle $53214$ may be thought of as a function $\\pi : X \\to X$ where $\\pi(i)$ equals the $i$-th number in the shuffle:\n\n$$\n\\pi(1) = 5, \\pi(2) = 3, \\pi(3) = 2, \\pi(4) = 1, \\pi(5) = 4.\n$$\n\nThese functions are often represented by a table:\n\n|      $i$ | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |\n|----------|---|---|---|---|---|\n| $\\pi(i)$ | 5 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 4 |\n\nSomething new added by the table/function representation is that we can talk about the inverse function which undoes the shuffle:\n\n|      $j = \\pi(i)$ | 5 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 4 |\n|-------------------|---|---|---|---|---|\n| $i = \\pi^{-1}(j)$ | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |\n\nor reordering the columns:\n\n|           $j$ | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |\n|---------------|---|---|---|---|---|\n| $\\pi^{-1}(j)$ | 4 | 3 | 2 | 5 | 1 |\n\n### Composition of functions\n\nGiven two permutations, $\\pi_1, \\pi_2 : X \\to X$, we can compose them to get a new function $(\\pi_1 \\circ \\pi_2)$. One way to compute this is via the following procedure:\n\n1. Write the two functions as tables.\n2. Reorder the columns of the outermost function in the composition to align with the output of the innermost function.\n3. Stack the tables on top of each other.\n\nE.g. Take $\\pi_2$ to be the function represented by the shuffle $53214$ and take $\\pi_1$ to be represented by the shuffle $13254$. So as a table\n\n|        $i$ | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |\n|------------|---|---|---|---|---|\n| $\\pi_1(i)$ | 1 | 3 | 2 | 5 | 4 |\n\nNow we shuffle the columns so the top is $53214$:\n\n|        $i$ | 5 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 4 |\n|------------|---|---|---|---|---|\n| $\\pi_1(i)$ | 4 | 2 | 3 | 1 | 5 |\n\nThen stack this with $\\pi_2$:\n\n|            $i$ | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |\n|----------------|---|---|---|---|---|\n| $j = \\pi_2(i)$ | 5 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 4 |\n| $\\pi_1(j)$     | 4 | 2 | 3 | 1 | 5 |\n\nThe bottom row is $\\pi_1 \\circ \\pi_2$.\n\n::: {#exr-compute-product}\n###\n\nCompute this in the other order: $\\pi_2 \\circ \\pi_1$. *Observe that the order matters.*\n\nNote: in some sources (e.g. books, software), compositions are written as a product in the reverse order. Sometimes there is an option provided to reverse the multiplication order.
