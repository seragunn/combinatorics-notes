An **inversion** for $\\pi$ is a pair of outputs which are not in sorted order. I.e. we have $i < j$ to begin with and $\\pi(i) > \\pi(j)$ to end with.\n\nIn counting inversions, we look at where $\\pi(i)$ is greater than $\\pi(j)$ for some $j$ that comes after $i$.\n\n::: {#exm-inversions}\n###\nConsider the permutation represented by $31254$.\n\nWe have $\\pi(1) = 3$ and this is greater than both $\\pi(2) = 1, \\pi(3) = 2$.\n\nWe have $\\pi(2) = 1$ but this is not greater than anything that comes after.\n\nWe have $\\pi(3) = 2$ but this is not greater than anything that comes after.\n\nWe have $\\pi(4) = 5$ which is greater than $\\pi(5) = 4$.\n\nSo this permutation has $3$ inversions: $(1 < 2) \\to (\\pi(1) > \\pi(2))$ and $(1 < 3) \\to (\\pi(1) > \\pi(3))$ and $(4 < 5) \\to (\\pi(4) > \\pi(5))$.\n\nWe can use SageMath to check our work:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.sage .cell-code}\nπ = Permutation([3,1,2,5,4])\nπ.inversions()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=1}\n```\n[(1, 2), (1, 3), (4, 5)]\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n## Parity of the number of inversions\n\nInversions as a concept have a few uses in combinatorics. Relavent to us now is that the number of inversions has the same parity as the permutation. To show this, we will consider how a single transposition affects this parity. But since the total number can go up or down, let us define a quantity which we can analyze to describe the parity.\n\nFor the identity permutation, define\n$$\nV(1) = \\prod_{i < j} (j - i)\n$$\n\nE.g. for $n = 4$ this is $(2 - 1)(3 - 1)(4 - 1)(3 - 2)(4 - 2)(4 - 3)$. We're not interested in the absolute value here but rather the sign---which for the identity permutation is $+1$.\n\nMore generally, define\n$$\nV(\\pi) = \\prod_{i < j}(\\pi(j) - \\pi(i)).\n$$\n\nNote that we will have a factor of $V(\\pi)$ which is negative whenever $i < j$ and $\\pi(i) > \\pi(j)$. So the sign of $V(\\pi)$ tells us the parity of the number of inversions.\n\nWhat's useful here is that factoring out the various $-1$'s and reordering, we can write $V(\\pi) = \\pm V(1)$ where it is a $+1$ if we have an even number of inversions and a $-1$ if we have an odd number.\n\n## Analysis\n\nWe want to show that a single transposition changes $V(1)$ to $-V(1)$. Then a sequence of odd length will have a sign of $-1$ and one of even length will have a sign of $+1$, matching what we did in @sec-sign.\n\nSuppose we apply the transposition $(ij)$ with $i < j$. Right away, we get one inversion because now $\\pi(i) > \\pi(j)$. Let's look at the other numbers. Suppose $x < i < j$. Then after swapping, we still have $x$ on the left of $i,j$$ so no inversions here. Likewise, if $i < j < x$ then $x$ will still be on the right afterwards.\n\nThe last case is that $i < x < j$. Then we get two inversions going from $i,x,j$ to $j,x,i$. One between $i$ and $x$ and one between $x$ and $j$ since both these pairs are now out of order.\n\nTo summarize, this single transposition gives us:\n\n- $0$ inversions for anything left of $i$ or right of $j$,\n- $2$ inversions for each number in between,\n- $1$ inversion for the pair $i, j$\n\nSo overall we get an odd number of inversions for each swap. This shows that the number of inversions is odd if and only if the number of swaps is odd.\n\n",
