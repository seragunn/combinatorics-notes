# Stars and Bars Revisited

Suppose we have $2$ people and $n$ identical objects to distribute. Let's say for now that a person gets $0$ or more objects but all $n$ objects are distributed. An example arrangement we might create with stars and bars would look like
$$
*****\mid***.
$$
The key insight is that if we change this to
$$
0\,0\,0\,0\,0\mid1\,1\,1.
$$
Now it looks like the problem we studied in @sec-0s-then-1s. The bar here is no longer necessary to know where the first group ends and the second begins.

Now we can check that our stars-and-bars formula agrees with the formula computed in @sec-0s-then-1s. Indeed, that formula is
$$
\binom{n + 1}{1} = n + 1.
$$

## From 2 people to k people
Let's copy the key insight for the $k = 2$ case. A distribution of $n$ objects to $k$ people, with each receiving $0$ or more, looks like a string
$$
1\cdots12\cdots23\cdots3\cdots\cdots k\cdots k.
$$
Here the number of $i$s in the string is the number of objects person $i$ receives. E.g.
$$
1122223555
$$
means person $1$ receives $2$ objects, person $2$ receives $4$, person $3$ receives $1$, person $5$ receives $3$, and everyone else (including person $4$) receives none.

### Applying the multiplication theorem

Let $L_i$ be the language of strings consisting of $0$ or more of the character $i$. Then the stars-and-bars language for $k$ people, is $L_1 L_2 \cdots L_k$. We also know from @sec-geom-series that each of these language has a generating function of $\frac{1}{1-x}$. It follows that our stars-and-bars language has a generating function of
$$
\frac{1}{(1 - x)^k} = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \binom{n + k}{k} x^n.
$$
We know these are the coefficients because we know there are $\binom{n + k}{k}$ stars-and-bars strings of length $n$ (i.e. that many ways to distribute the $n$ objects among $k$ people).

::: {#exr-proof-by-derivatives}
Use proof by induction to show that
$$
\frac{1}{(1 - x)^k} = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \binom{n + k}{k} x^n.
$$
Use the derivative to go from case $k$ to case $k + 1$. Take the geometric series as the base case ($k = 1$).

Hint: the derivative is going to reduce the exponent from $x^n$ to $x^{n - 1}$ so to get a step ahead of that, we can add $1$ everywhere we see $n$:
$$
\frac{1}{(1 - x)^k} = \sum_{n + 1 = 0}^\infty \binom{n + 1 + k}{k} x^{n + 1}.
$$
